Libft – My First Project at 42 Lyon 🎓

Welcome to Libft! 🎉 My very first project at 42 Lyon, where I built my own C library from scratch. 🔧

⸻

📝 Project Description

Libft is a personal C library that contains a collection of essential functions for handling strings, memory, and data conversions.
It serves as a reusable foundation for future projects at 42, helping to save time and improve code reliability.

⸻

📚 Main Features

🔹 Part 1 – Standard C Library Functions

Re-implemented standard functions such as:
ft_memset, ft_bzero, ft_memcpy, ft_memmove, ft_strlen, ft_strlcpy, ft_strlcat,
ft_strchr, ft_strrchr, ft_strncmp, ft_memchr, ft_memcmp, ft_strnstr, ft_atoi,
ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isalnum, ft_isascii, ft_isprint, ft_toupper, ft_tolower,
plus allocation functions: ft_calloc, ft_strdup.

⸻

🔹 Part 2 – Additional Functions

Extra utility functions not found in the standard C library:
	•	ft_substr, ft_strjoin, ft_strtrim, ft_split, ft_itoa
	•	ft_strmapi, ft_striteri
	•	File descriptor output: ft_putchar_fd, ft_putstr_fd, ft_putendl_fd, ft_putnbr_fd

⸻

🔹 Bonus Part – Linked Lists

Once the mandatory part was complete, I implemented linked list utilities:
ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_front, ft_lstsize, ft_lstlast, ft_lstadd_back,
ft_lstdelone, ft_lstclear, ft_lstiter, ft_lstmap

🛠️ Usage

⚙️ Compilation

The project includes a Makefile that compiles the source files into a static library called libft.a.

# Compile the library
make

# Remove object files
make clean

# Remove object files and the library
make fclean

# Recompile everything
make re

💡 Example of Use

#include "libft.h"

int main(void)
{
    char *str = "Hello, 42!";
    int len = ft_strlen(str);
    printf("String length: %d\n", len);
    return (0);
}

🚀 Learning Goals

This project helped me to:
✅ Strengthen my understanding of the C language
✅ Master memory management and pointers
✅ Use Makefiles to automate builds
✅ Build a solid foundation for all future 42 projects
